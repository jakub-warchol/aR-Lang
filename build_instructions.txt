1. Build app in Release mode
2. Download https://github.com/probonopd/linuxdeployqt/releases/download/continuous/linuxdeployqt-continuous-x86_64.AppImage and copy to the directory above the build and source.
3. To build release directory, copy application's icon and .desktop file:
[Desktop Entry]
Type=Application
Name=aR-Lang
Comment=Create beautiful chains of arithmetic calculations
Icon=aR-Lang
Categories=Science;
X-AppImage-Version=

4. In the release directory, open terminal.
5. In the terminal, execute: export PATH=/path/to//Qt/version/gcc_64/bin/:$PATH
6. Now, ../linuxdeployqt-continuous-x86_64.AppImage ./aR-Lang -qmldir=../aR-Lang/gui/ (this operations may take a while, be patient).
7. Execute: ../linuxdeployqt-continuous-x86_64.AppImage ./aR-Lang -qmldir=../aR-Lang/gui/ -appimage
8. Voila. The Appimage file has been created!
